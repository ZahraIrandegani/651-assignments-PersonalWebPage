I've created four  HTML pages: index.html, about.html, resume.html,	contact.html

**For the HTML requirements :**
- I've implemented tables in resume.html to display my education history
- The about.html page includes an unordered list of my personal information
- Images are used throughout the site, including profile pictures and hobby icons

**For styling and responsiveness :**
- I've used Bootstrap 4 for the layout, particularly in the grid system for the hobbies section in resume.html
- The navigation bar is a Bootstrap component that collapses into a hamburger menu on mobile devices
- I've implemented mobile-responsive design using @media queries, which adjust the layout for smaller screens

**Key CSS features include :**
- ID selectors for unique elements like #header and #main
- Class selectors for repeated elements like .hobby-card and .progress
- The progress bars in the skills section demonstrate both Bootstrap integration and custom styling
- The contact form uses Bootstrap's grid system with responsive columns

**Some notable features :**
- The skills section uses animated progress bars
- The hobbies section uses a card-based layout that reorganizes on mobile devices
- The contact page includes an embedded map and a functional contact form
- Social media links are consistently available in the header across all pages
